# Inconsistent Hover States in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using hover states with Tailwind CSS, particularly in conjunction with dark mode or complex utility classes.

The bug manifests as unexpected behavior: hover states may not apply correctly or may produce visually inconsistent results.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is the inconsistent application of hover effects.  In certain scenarios, particularly when combining multiple utility classes or using dark mode, the expected hover state changes might not occur or may appear differently than anticipated.

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully reviewing your Tailwind CSS configuration, ensuring proper class application, and potentially simplifying the utility classes used to minimize conflicts.  In some cases, adding specific specificity rules or using the `!important` flag might be necessary, although this is generally discouraged.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
4. Observe the hover effects on the button.  Note any inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.

## Additional Notes

* This bug might be related to conflicting styles, improperly ordered classes, or a lack of specificity in your CSS.
* Always try to use the simplest and most direct Tailwind classes possible.
* Debugging and inspecting the rendered CSS can help pinpoint the source of the problem.
